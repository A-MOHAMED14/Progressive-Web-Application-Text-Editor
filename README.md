# Progressive Web Application (PWA): Text-Editor

## Description

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that runs in the browser, designed to work both online and offline. The application uses IndexedDB, with the help of the idb package, to store and retrieve data efficiently. It leverages Webpack for bundling JavaScript files and automatically generating the HTML, service worker, and manifest files. The service worker, implemented using Workbox, ensures that static assets are pre-cached for offline use. The app also includes an "Install" button for downloading the web application as a desktop icon.
